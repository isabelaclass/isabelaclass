# 💫 About Me

Hey! I'm **Isabela**, a software developer passionate about building smart, scalable solutions that connect artificial intelligence, automation, and real business impact.

🔍 My focus is on AI-driven development. I work with tools like **GPT (Azure OpenAI)** and **Azure AI tools (AI Search, Document Intelligence and others)**, developing APIs and solutions that bring value through document indexing, semantic search, and intelligent automation.

In the past, I’ve worked with **Microsoft Dynamics 365 Finance and Operations (X++)**, supporting ERP customizations and integrations. I also have hands-on experience with **Power Platform**, **C# .NET**, and other technologies that support digital transformation at scale.

I'm currently deepening my knowledge in **AI, backend architecture**, and exploring how to make technology more accessible, responsible, and transformative.

## 🎵 Personal Side

When I’m not coding, I’m probably reading a book, at a concert 🎶, traveling ✈️, cuddling with my cats 🐱, or enjoying great food 🍣. I believe in living fully, learning constantly, and coding with meaning.
